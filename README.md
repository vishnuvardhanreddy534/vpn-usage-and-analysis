# VPN Usage and Analysis

## 🔍 Objective
This project demonstrates how to set up, test, and analyze a free VPN service for privacy and performance. It includes practical steps, observations, and a summary of VPN benefits and limitations.

---

## 🧭 Steps Performed

1. **Choose a reputable free VPN** (e.g., ProtonVPN, Windscribe, or PrivadoVPN).
2. **Download and install** the VPN client on your system.
3. **Connect to a VPN server** (closest or any location of choice).
4. **Verify IP change** using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
5. **Browse securely** and confirm encryption is active.
6. **Disconnect VPN** and note differences in speed and IP.
7. **Research** encryption protocols and privacy features.
8. **Summarize** VPN benefits and limitations.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- VPN hides your real IP and location.
- Encryption protects traffic on insecure networks.
- Browsing speed may decrease due to encryption overhead.
- Free VPNs have limitations (speed, servers, data caps).
- VPNs do **not** guarantee complete anonymity or malware protection.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Automate IP and speed testing using Python.
- Compare multiple VPNs using the same test script.
- Add a privacy audit checklist for each VPN provider.
