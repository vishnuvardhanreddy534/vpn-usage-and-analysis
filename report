# VPN Experiment Report

## Objective
To analyze how VPNs change IP address, encrypt traffic, and affect browsing performance.

---

## Procedure

1. Selected **ProtonVPN (Free Plan)**.
2. Installed client on Windows 10.
3. Connected to a server in Singapore.
4. Verified IP address before and after connection.
5. Conducted browsing and speed tests.
6. Compared performance and documented results.

## Observations

| Metric | Without VPN | With VPN |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| IP Address | 49.xx.xx.xx (India) | 185.xx.xx.xx (Singapore) |
| Download Speed | 47 Mbps | 31 Mbps |
| Upload Speed | 25 Mbps | 18 Mbps |
| Ping | 8 ms | 48 ms |

## Findings

- The IP address successfully changed, proving VPN tunneling worked.
- Encryption was active (HTTPS lock visible; verified via DNS leak test).
- VPN added minor latency but protected identity and location.
- No DNS leaks detected.
- Free VPNs have limited bandwidth and server options.

## Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations

### ✅ Benefits
- Hides real IP address and physical location.
- Encrypts traffic on public Wi-Fi.
- Helps bypass geographic restrictions.
- Provides additional privacy against ISP tracking.

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Reduced speed and increased latency.
- Some free VPNs log or share data.
- Limited server choices and bandwidth.
- Doesn’t protect against phishing or malware.

## Conclusion
Using a VPN enhances online privacy and security by encrypting network traffic and hiding the user’s IP address. However, performance trade-offs and provider trustworthiness must be considered. For critical or long-term use, a **paid VPN with audited no-log policy** is recommended.
